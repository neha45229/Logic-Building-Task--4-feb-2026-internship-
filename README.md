# Logic-Building-Task--4-feb-2026-internship-
my fourth task with innomatics research lab
In this task for all the problem statement to give its solution(code), I have notified (or) instructed to use functions.
Functions are the most important and useful part of python coding which helps in randomly repetition of any statement (or) specific block of code which is needs to be repeat or where you got stopped.
So,in this i have used functions related to various problem solutions and loops for better performance.
